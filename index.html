        <h3>Blockchain</h3>
        A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a
        database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their
        crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of
        transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of
        data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

        One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain
        collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain
        storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of
        data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly
        formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.

        A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, as its name implies, structures its
        data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible
        timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and
        becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the
        chain.
        <br><br>
        <h3>How does it works?</h3>
        The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this
        way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered,
        deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT).First
        proposed as a research project in 1991, the blockchain concept predated its first widespread application in use:
        Bitcoin, in 2009. In the years since, the use of blockchains has exploded via the creation of various
        cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Is blockchain secure?</h3>
        Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are
        always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the “end” of the blockchain. After
        a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to go back and alter the contents
        of the block unless a majority of the network has reached a consensus to do so. That's because each block
        contains its own hash, along with the hash of the block before it, as well as the previously mentioned
        timestamp. Hash codes are created by a mathematical function that turns digital information into a string of
        numbers and letters. If that information is edited in any way, then the hash code changes as well.

        Let's say that a hacker, who also runs a node on a blockchain network, wants to alter a blockchain and steal
        cryptocurrency from everyone else. If they were to alter their own single copy, it would no longer align with
        everyone else's copy. When everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would see this
        one copy stand out, and that hacker's version of the chain would be cast away as illegitimate.

        Succeeding with such a hack would require that the hacker simultaneously control and alter 51% or more of the
        copies of the blockchain so that their new copy becomes the majority copy and, thus, the agreed-upon chain. Such
        an attack would also require an immense amount of money and resources, as they would need to redo all of the
        blocks because they would now have different timestamps and hash codes.

        Due to the size of many cryptocurrency networks and how fast they are growing, the cost to pull off such a feat
        probably would be insurmountable. This would be not only extremely expensive but also likely fruitless. Doing
        such a thing would not go unnoticed, as network members would see such drastic alterations to the blockchain.
        The network members would then hard fork off to a new version of the chain that has not been affected. This
        would cause the attacked version of the token to plummet in value, making the attack ultimately pointless, as
        the bad actor has control of a worthless asset. The same would occur if the bad actor were to attack the new
        fork of Bitcoin. It is built this way so that taking part in the network is far more economically incentivized
        than attacking it.

      <div class="accordion-body">Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to
        the natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of
        intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize
        its chance of achieving its goals
        <br><br>
        The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human"
        cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". This
        definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and
        acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.
        <br><br>
        AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube,
        Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla),
        automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
        As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
        definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.For instance, optical character recognition is frequently
        excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
        <br><br>
        Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced
        several waves of optimism followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter") followed
        by new approaches, success and renewed funding AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches
        since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large
        databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly
        mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly
        successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.

        IBM has a rich history with machine learning. One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited for coining the term,
        “machine learning” with his research (PDF, 481 KB) (link resides outside IBM) around the game of checkers.
        Robert Nealey, the self-proclaimed checkers master, played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, and he lost
        to the computer. Compared to what can be done today, this feat seems trivial, but it's considered a major
        milestone in the field of artificial intelligence.
        <br><br>
        Over the last couple of decades, the technological advances in storage and processing power have enabled some
        innovative products based on machine learning, such as Netflix's recommendation engine and self-driving cars.
        <br><br>
        Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical
        methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data
        mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally
        impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists
        will increase. They will be required to help identify the most relevant business questions and the data to
        answer them.
        <br><br>
        Machine learning algorithms are typically created using frameworks that accelerate solution development, such as
        TensorFlow and PyTorch.

      <div class="accordion-body">Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices,
        electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology
        security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile
        computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Cyber security</strong> is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted
        attackers or opportunistic malware.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Application security</strong> focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised
        application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design
        stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Information security</strong> protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in
        transit.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Operational security</strong> includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data
        assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data
        may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Disaster recovery and business continuity</strong> define how an organization responds to a
        cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery
        policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating
        capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to
        operate without certain resources.
        <br><br>
        <strong>End-user education</strong> addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can
        accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices.
        Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other
        important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.

        Ethical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or
        organization's infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a
        network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can
        exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand attacks better or divert them.
        <br><br>
        The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such activities in order
        to test the system's defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more
        importantly, legal.
        <br><br>
        Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or
        destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the
        system/network/applications. By doing so, they can improve the security footprint so that it can better
        withstand attacks or divert them.
        <br><br>
        Ethical hackers are hired by organizations to look into the vulnerabilities of their systems and networks and
        develop solutions to prevent data breaches. Consider it a high-tech permutation of the old saying “It takes a
        thief to catch a thief.”

        1. <strong> Stay legal </strong> Obtain proper approval before accessing and performing a security assessment.
        <br>
        2. <strong>Define the scope.</strong> Determine the scope of the assessment so that the ethical hacker's work
